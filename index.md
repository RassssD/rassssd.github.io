Hi! I am a 1st year MRes/PhD student in Economics at the London School of Economics.

### Education
* MRes/PhD Economics, LSE
* MSc Economics, LSE (2024)
* BSc Economics, UCL (2023)


### Research
My research areas span Public Economics and Political Economy: I am interested in how governments can design, evaluate, and adapt policies to promote innovation and social mobility, and how this interacts with voter preferences to shape political outcomes.

    For my <a href="papers/MSc_Dissertation_RasmusDuret.pdf">MSc dissertation</a>, I used administrative data from Sweden to investigate how a COVID-related change to students' stipend conditions affected their choice to work part-time. Using bunching, instrumental variables, and diff-in-diff methods, I estimated large behavioural responses: a 10-12% increase in average income, and significant flows into education.

    For my <a href="papers/BSc_Dissertation_RasmusDuret.pdf">BSc dissertation</a>, I developed a simple network-based model of social capital to provide a theoretical background to the empirical findings of Chetty et al. (2022), and replicated their key findings of emergent segregation using county-level US data.
