    For my [MSc dissertation](papers/MSc_Dissertation_RasmusDuret.pdf), I used administrative data from Sweden to investigate how a COVID-related change to students' stipend conditions affected their choice to work part-time. Using bunching, instrumental variables, and diff-in-diff methods, I estimated large behavioural responses: a 10-12% increase in average income.

For my [BSc dissertation](papers/BSc_Dissertation_RasmusDuret.pdf), I developed a simple network-based model of social capital to provide a theoretical background to the empirical findings of Chetty et al. (2022), and replicated their key findings of emergent segregation using county-level US data.
