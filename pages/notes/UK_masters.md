### Choosing Modules

Picking modules you find interesting is never a bad choice.
Don't be scared of picking modules which have a reputation for being difficult: 1) you will need to do them anyways if you go on to further studies, 2) 

Module choices should complement and be consistent with whatever signal you are sending as part of your application. If you are interested in further studies, you should also be interested in more advanced modules; if you are picking advanced modules, you will likely be a good fit for further studies.

Take some formal mathematics course: you will learn to do proofs and how to approach problems in a more general and formal way: logic, analysis, statistics... More mathematics is never going to be a bad thing, but your focus should still be econ.

Take modules with research elements, and if possible do an undergraduate dissertation.


### Masters' in the UK
The programmes at the top 4 universities are, on the whole, roughly equally good, and none of them would be a bad decision. They are each slightly better at different things, keep that in mind when applying. A rough overview based on my impression and talking with friends that went to each:

Oxford
* MPhil Econ: Different in that it is a 2-year course which feeds into their 3-year DPhil. You will have more advanced courses in the 2nd year. Great programme from what I have heard, the 2-year structure lets you go further, but that's also an extra year of fees.
* MPhil EconDev: Can't speak to this as it isn't my field, but my understanding is that it's a fantastic programme if DevEcon is your area of interest.

Cambridge
* MPhil Econ: Good if you want to get an extra degree and then work in industry, finance, etc. Do the research one if you want to do research.
* MPhil Research: Feeds into their own DPhil, more advanced. You only get to pick one optional module, and the poor (IMO) selection led me to not choose this one.

LSE
* MSc Econ: I did this one! Excellent course overall, core courses are great and all optionals are fantastic. The 6000-word "Extended Essay" is due right around exam season, which contributes to making an already tough course even more intense. Has a reputation of being a cash-cow (which it is to some degree), but genuinely great teaching, faculty involvement, material, and a strong cohort. I had a good time!
NB: You have the option of following the EME Micro course, conditional on qualifying. You can also take the intro course and then decide.
* MSc EME: Probably the best and most prestigious MSc on the planet if you plan to do a PhD/research, as it is basically a PhD-level course in micro/macro/metrics crammed into an MSc. Excellent if you can manage it and like theory, but not a strict upgrade over the normal MSc if you do not. Keep in mind the effects of added difficulty in terms of your results, both in absolute and relative to the more selective cohort!
NB: You will have the option of switching to the normal MSc after qualifying exams if you don't qualify or would prefer to.

UCL
* MSc Econ: Great programme overall with more flexibility than the others, letting you pick advanced or more applied courses in the second term. All of them are excellent, the advanced ones are great PhD prep.
