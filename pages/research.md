        Sweden provides generous financial support for students in higher education, and disintentivises excessive part-time work by reducing support received if income exceeds a certain threshold. This threshold was temporarily removed during the COVID-19 pandemic, with the intent to support students’ finances through the crisis. I provide the first examination of the effects of this reform using individual-level administrative data on the entire Swedish student population, and combine three research designs: bunching, simulated instrumental variables, and differences-in-differences. Consistent with theoretical predictions, I observe significant behavioural responses. Students increase their incomes by 10-12% on average, driven especially by high-earners and partially by individuals switching between student and non-student status during the pandemic. These results help inform  the design of study aid systems balancing academic achievement with part-time work, as well as policies aiming to support students through economic shocks.

    I use administrative data from Sweden to investigate how a COVID-related change to students' stipend conditions affected their choice to work part-time. Using bunching, instrumental variables, and diff-in-diff methods, I estimated large behavioural responses: a 10-12% increase in average income implying an ETI of ~0.1, and significant flows into education.

    For my <a href="resources/papers/BSc_Dissertation_RasmusDuret.pdf">BSc dissertation</a>, I developed a simple network-based model of social capital to provide a theoretical background to the empirical findings of Chetty et al. (2022), and replicated their key findings of emergent segregation using county-level US data.
